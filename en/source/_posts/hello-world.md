### The site actually works now!
After many "commits" and a lot of trial and error we managed to get this website up and running.
For the tinkerer in you we have the source code available [on GitHub](https://github.com/cansat-icarus/cansat-icarus.github.io-source).

Some pages are still missings/incomplete: the [About](/en/about.html) and [Mission](/en/mission.html) pages but they will be populated soon enough.
